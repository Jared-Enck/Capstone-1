# Features

Then name and save the deck.

#  API Notes  

URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14059948/TzecB4fH#5d82e651-26d7-4c58-8b9a-f021f5cc1dfd  

The API is pretty straight foward with only two endpoints. One for getting all cards and the other for getting cards by name, or other params.  

It does have a rate limit of fifteen calls per ten seconds. So it was fine for searching cards (with low user base). However, I was unable to use it for getting all cards in a deck. So I ended up saving all the cards from the series I used for this site in my seed file. This way I could just pull the card info for the cards needed from my database.
